Welcome to my blog! I will try, with G-ds help, to post some tutorials and explanations of core / interesting
coding concepts. I hope to create some guides on how to create your own blockchain, learn golang, and perhaps
deep dive into some beginner concepts. Feel free to reach out with any questions or comments.
